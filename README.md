# Project Reflection: Computational Graphics and Visualization


This repository contains the two required components of my project:

3D Scene ZIP Folder – a fully realized 3D environment demonstrating the application of computational graphics concepts.

Design Decisions Document – a written explanation of the technical and creative choices made throughout the development process.

Together, these components showcase my understanding of the 3D graphics development pipeline and my ability to design, implement, and refine a complete visual scene.

# How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design by first understanding the problem and defining clear goals and constraints. For this project, that meant identifying the purpose of the 3D scene, the visual style, and the technical requirements. I focused on planning the structure of the scene, asset organization, and interactions before writing or implementing components. This approach helped ensure that design decisions were intentional and aligned with the project objectives.

# What new design skills has this project helped me develop?

This project strengthened my ability to think spatially and visually when designing software. I learned how to balance aesthetics with performance, plan camera perspectives and lighting, and design scenes that guide user attention. I also improved my ability to document design decisions clearly, which is critical when communicating technical ideas to others.

# What design process did I follow?

I followed an iterative design process that included planning, prototyping, testing, and refinement. I began with a rough layout of the scene, added core objects and textures, adjusted lighting and transformations, and continuously refined the scene based on visual results and technical limitations. Feedback from testing helped guide improvements at each milestone.

# How could this design approach be applied in future work?

The tactics used in this project—early planning, modular design, and iterative refinement—can be applied to future software and graphics projects. This approach supports scalability, makes debugging easier, and helps ensure that final products meet both functional and visual goals.

# How do I approach developing programs?

I approach development methodically by breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable components. In this project, I implemented and tested individual elements such as object placement, textures, lighting, and camera movement before integrating them into the full scene. This reduced errors and made troubleshooting more efficient.

# What new development strategies did I use?

I used incremental development and frequent testing to ensure that each addition worked as intended. I also relied more heavily on debugging tools and visual validation, which is especially important in graphics programming where small changes can have significant visual effects.

# How did iteration factor into development?

Iteration played a critical role throughout the project. Each milestone involved refining previous work—adjusting transformations, improving lighting realism, optimizing object placement, and correcting visual artifacts. Repeated iteration allowed the scene to gradually evolve into a polished final product.

# How has my development approach evolved over time?

As the project progressed, my approach became more structured and efficient. I learned to anticipate potential issues earlier, write cleaner and more organized code, and make design choices that supported future changes. By the final milestone, I was more confident in both my technical skills and my problem-solving process.

# How can computer science help me reach my goals?

Computer science provides a foundation for solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions. Skills such as logical thinking, algorithmic design, and system-level understanding are applicable across many industries. This project reinforced how technical knowledge can be combined with creativity to build meaningful and engaging experiences.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations support my educational pathway?

Computational graphics and visualization have given me hands-on experience with concepts such as transformations, lighting models, rendering pipelines, and spatial reasoning. These skills will support advanced coursework in computer graphics, game development, simulation, and visualization-focused disciplines.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations support my professional pathway?

Professionally, these skills are applicable in fields such as game development, virtual reality, simulation, data visualization, and user interface design. This project demonstrates my ability to translate abstract concepts into interactive visual systems, making me better prepared for roles that require both technical proficiency and creative problem-solving.
